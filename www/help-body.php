           <h1>What is DiEM Caf&eacute;?</h1>
 <p>We would like to invite you to take part in a completely new debating experience in DiEM25, an online World Caf&eacute;. This debate methodology has a very long and successful track record and is well documented <a href="http://www.theworldcafe.com/">here</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>We are creating a website which we would like to call the DiEM Café, a sort of new public space which we hope will be used many times again in the future.</p>
 <p>Before we get into details, note that we need many volunteers to become <i>hosts</i>. Being a host is very easy: the role and responsibilities of hosts are described <a href="#host">here</a>. Please volunteer if you want to make this amazing experiment possible. Should we have more host volunteers than are actually needed, the final hosts will be chosen randomly by the web app.</p>

         <p>Please register in advance, the sooner the better for the organisation. We need your email address to contact you, your name for the people who are going to talk to you and your language preferences (please see this important <a href="#language">note</a> about language). We also need to know if you volunteer to host a table, it is really easy and VERY important. Please <a href="register.php">click here</a> for details.</p>

         <h2>Login</h2>
           <p>You can take part in the conversation if you log in <b>10 minutes</b> before the event. Once you log in you will see the programme for the event with the questions to be discussed and precise times. If you need to leave the event, please log out so your table companions are not left alone.</p>

        <a name="zoom"></a>
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-alt">
          <h2>Zoom</h2>
          <p>Zoom is a videoconferencing tool which will be used for the DiEM25 Caf&eacute;. You need to download it in advance and test it with a friend if possible, to avoid sound issues.</p>
<p>You can download the Zoom Client for Meetings <a href="https://zoom.us/download" target="_blank">here</a>. It's available for most operating systems on PCs and mobile devices and as browser plugin for Chrome and Firefox. (For installation under Linux please see <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/204206269-Linux-Installation" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Once you have zoom installed, clicking on the &ldquo;Join&rdquo; link from a <a href="#table">table</a> will launch Zoom and take you to the meeting.</p>

<p>To become the host of a new meeting you need to click on &ldquo;sign in&rdquo; and generate an account (or connect to a social network). After signing in, another window opens where you click on &ldquo;Start with video&rdquo; to start a new meeting. The meeting window will open and zoom should automatically recognise your camera and microphone settings. Post the link to the meeting in the table tab so the other participants can click &ldquo;Join&rdquo; to join the meeting.</p>

        <a name="section"></a>
<div class="jumbotron">
          <h2>Sections</h2>
          <p>The event is divided into sections. During each section the same question or set of questions is discussed at many tables at the same time, for several (normally three) <a href="#round">rounds</a>. There will be a break between sections and shorter breaks between rounds to give a chance for hosts to prepare the next round and for everyone to stretch their legs.</p>

        <a name="round"></a>
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-alt">
          <h2>Rounds</h2>
          <p>A round of discussion is a 22 minute period during which all groups discuss around their tables, in the same Zoom conference, a question which will be displayed on the screen. At the end of the round there will be a tone to let you know that time is up. Starting then you have three extra minutes before the pad gets locked.</p>
          <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        </div>
        <a name="table"></a>
<div class="jumbotron">
          <h2>Tables</h2>
          <p>A café table is a virtual place where the same question is discussed for several rounds by different groups of people. Only the host remains at the same table and the same language will be used for all rounds in a section.</p>

<p>Once you click the button to go to your first table, you will see the table screen. There, when the host is ready, you will find the link to the Zoom video conference. Click Join and if that doesn’t work paste the link in a new tab. We recommend <b>not</b> closing the tabs until the end of the event, and certainly not until the round is finished.</p>

<p>In the table screen you will see, on the left hand side, the summary of the notes from the previous round, a list of the users invited to the table, and, on the right hand side, an empty space for notes. Please read about <a href="#notes">notes</a> before you use it. At the end of each round the pad will contain the most important thoughts, or ideas discussed.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
      </div>
<a name="notes"></a>
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-alt">
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>This discussion must produce a tangible result for us to have a better understanding of our common or diverging points of view. In order to make information manageable, notes should have a maximum length of 140 characters, and a pad will be full once 5 notes have been submitted.</p>

<p>Notes cannot be deleted, and they should reflect the most important issues, ideas or conclusions discussed, so, please take a minute before you click &ldquo;Share&rdquo;. We invite you to discuss the notes in the Zoom chat before you actually share them in the table pad. Once the time is up, the pad will be locked - time to move to the next table.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
  </div>
<a name="language"></a>
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h2>Language</h2>
  <p>Our intention is to be as inclusive as possible. Many people speak only their mother tongue, and those people will take priority at the time of assigning discussion tables. However, if there are very few monolingual people from a language which is not widely spoken, like Esperanto, they may find they do not meet people from other nationalities or cultures. This is unfortunate but unavoidable.</p>

<p>If you are comfortable with more than one language, do not be shy, particularly if it is a less spoken one. Your language skills will help to create an interesting mix and make the DiEM Café a truly pan-European experience.</p>

  <a name="host"></a>
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-alt">
    <h2>Hosting a table</h2>
<p>We need a tiny bit of help from you. The DiEM Café is a platform which depends on users to do part of the work. Very little, it is true, but essential. Each Café table consists of a browser tab from the DiEM Café site and a Zoom video conference screen. At each table one user will be the &ldquo;table host&rdquo;, who is responsible for creating the conference and posting the meeting ID in the table tab.
Additionally we ask the table host to add the relevant information to the pad in the wrap up time if other users have not done so.</p>
<p>The table host is not necessarily a moderator, however she or he has a few simple tasks to do which are described in the <a href="#etiquette">table etiquette</a>.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
  </div>
  <a name="etiquette"></a>
<div class="jumbotron">
    <h2>Etiquette</h2>
<p>The DiEM Café is, above all, about sharing without concerns our views with other DiEM25 members. A cooperative, constructive and relaxed atmosphere is what we should strive for. We propose a very basic <a href="#conduct">code of conduct</a>.</p>
<p>To use time most effectively we suggest the following order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The debate may start as soon as everyone is present.</li>
<li>The host asks if people want the session to be spontaneous or moderated.</li>
<li>If necessary a moderator is appointed.</li>
<li>A short introduction of all the table members.</li>
<li>The host will quickly run through the results from the previous session (2 minutes max.)</li>
<li>Debate of the question.</li>
<li>Notes are taken as described.</li>
<li>Enjoy the conversation and come back to the next event.</li>
</ol>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
</div>

<a name="conduct"></a>
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-alt">
  <h2>Suggested Code of conduct</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be respectful to one another and try to give a chance to speak to the least outspoken.</li>
<li>Do not force anyone to speak.</li>
<li>Consider that there may be some people who do not have a camera on their computer.</li>
<li>Speak slowly and try to make yourself understood, <b>especially</b> if you are using your mother tongue.</li>
</ul>
